# Warrior-

## What is this plugin for?
This is for the McWars Network. It handles all the basics of the network. Without it, McWars would not function properly.

## Why is it open-sourced?
This is because Github is a great platform for the workflow of McWars. This is also the case because we can't afford a private repository plan for McWars. The third and final reason this is open-sourced is because we want staff and users of McWars to be able to suggest commits to add to our Warrior plugin for McWars. 

## Who develops WarriorCore?
At the moment the only developers are RainDropInMC and Whimpers, but we are looking for new developers. If you want to apply for the developer role, ask either ╲⎝⧹Whimpers⧸⎠╱#1503 or RainDropInMCYT#7502 on Discord via a direct message!
