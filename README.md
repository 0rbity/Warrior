# Warrior-

## What is this plugin for?
This is for the McWars Network. It handles all the basics of the network. Without it, McWars would not function properly.

## Why is it open-sourced.
Due to that Github is great for the workflow, and that we can't afford a private repository. It is also due to we want players and staff members and developers alike to make this core. 

## Who develops WarriorCore
At the moment the only developers are RainDropInMC and Whimpers, but we are looking for new devs. If you want to apply for dev ask either ╲⎝⧹Whimpers⧸⎠╱#1503 or RainDropInMCYT#7502 on discord!
